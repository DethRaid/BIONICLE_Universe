BIONICLE_Universe
=================

A BIONICLE-themed Role Playing Game

BIONICLE: Universe is primarily a singleplayer role-playing game (RPG) which takes place in the BIONICLE universe. It seeks to recapture the ideas and principles at place during the first few years of the BIONICLE storyline through a use of bright colors, non-violent game mechanics, and individual non-player characters (NPCs). Although it features an independent story, many long-time BIONICLE fans will recognize a number of elements from the BIONICLE comic books.

Graphics

  The graphics of BIONICLE: Universe will focus on texture detail over polygon density, allowing for greater detail in the particle effects necessary to represent elemental powers and allowing the game to run on older or less powerful computers.

Gameplay

	Many of the core mechanics of BIONICLE: Universe revolve around the idea of non-lethal conflict resolution and non-violent plot progression. What this means is that it will be easier to knock out or otherwise incapacitate an enemy than to kill that enemy and that there will often be severe penalties for killing anyone, Matoran or Rahi. As in the canon BIONICLE story, the Turaga will serve as mentors, giving the player plot-critical information. In addition, much of the story progression will come from dialogue, asking certain questions to figure out how to best protect the Matoran. Non-violent and non-lethal mechanics will certainly take the center stage

NPCs

	In the first few years of BIONICLE, one could discern between characters simply through their dialogue. Gali was wise and action-oriented, Lewa was always joking around, Tahu would threaten to try and get his way, Kopaka said the minimum he could, Onua would advocate discussion and planning, and Pohatu would try to keep the team together through his easygoing manner. However, the idea of main characters with differing personalities drifted out of the mainstream to make way for more homogenous Toa, presumably to appeal to a younger generation. BIONICLE: Universe will recapture the unique personalities of the first few years of BIONICLE, letting the player easily see how a Matoran's personality is representative of his element.

The Three Virtues

	Important to the BIONICLE storyline, the three Matoran virtues of Unity, Duty, and Destiny will come into play as central themes of BIONICLE: Universe. As a party-based game, BIONICLE: Universe will offer specialized party members for a variety of situations. The exact way this will happen can't be known until more of the game has been determined, however.

Nostalgia

	Playing through this game should elicit a very nostalgic response from the player. In addition to familiar locations, the player will recognize many other ideas from the BIONICLE storyline, be it a snippet of dialogue borrowed from the comics, a location adapted from the Mata Nui Online Game, or a reference to events from the official BIONICLE story. BIONICLE: Universe will certainly not forget its roots.
